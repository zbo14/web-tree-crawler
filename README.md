 *
 * @param  {String}   url
 * @param  {Object}   [opts = {}]
 * @param  {Number}   [opts.batchSize = 200] - the number of requests to send at a time
 * @param  {Object}   [opts.headers]         - headers to send with each request
 * @param  {String[]} [opts.startPaths]      - paths to initially crawl
 * @param  {Boolean}  [opts.stringify]       - stringify the tree
 * @param  {Number}   [opts.timeLimit = 120] - the max number of seconds to run for
 * @param  {Boolean}  [opts.verbose]         - if true, logs info and progress to stdout
 * @param  {}         [opts....]             - additional options for #lib.request()
